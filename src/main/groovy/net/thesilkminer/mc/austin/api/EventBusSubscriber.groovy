/**
 * Marks a class as a subscriber to a specific event bus.
 *
 * <p>Classes annotated with this annotation are automatically identified during Mojo construction and registered to the
 * targeted event bus. The mojo that owns this class must be specified in {@link EventBusSubscriber#modId()} to avoid
 * any potential class-loading errors.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every method that wants to listen to a posted event on the bus targeted through {@link EventBusSubscriber#bus()}
 * must be annotated with the {@link net.minecraftforge.eventbus.api.SubscribeEvent} annotation. Such methods must have
 * no return type (i.e. be {@code void}) and have a single parameter, representing the event that they want to listen
 * to. Additionally, if {@link EventBus#MOJO} is specified, the parameter must implement (directly or indirectly) the
 * {@link net.minecraftforge.fml.event.IModBusEvent} interface. It is a compile-time error if any of these constraints
 * are not followed. There are no constraints on the method type (i.e. static or virtual).</p>
 *
 * <p>It is also possible to specify a {@linkplain Dist distribution} on which the event bus subscriber will be
 * subscribed on. If the game is currently loading on a different distribution, the event subscriber will be simply
 * ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>A simple example of usage of this annotation is in the text that follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}EventBusSubscriber(modId = 'mymojo', bus = EventBus.MOJO)
 * class MySubscriber {
 *     {@literal @}SubscribeEvent
 *     void onCommonSetup(final FMLCommonSetupEvent e) {}
 * }
 * </pre>
